           <h3>That's Life</h3>

           <p>
               That's life (that's life), that's what all the people say <br>
               You're riding high in April <br>
               Shot down in May<br>
               But I know I'm gonna change that tune <br>
               When I'm back on top, back on top in June <br>
               <br>
               I said, that's life (that's life), and as funny as it may seem <br>
               Some people get their kicks <br>
               But I don't let it, let it get me down <br>
               'Cause this fine old world it keeps spinnin' around <br>
               <br>
               I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, <br>
               A poet, a pawn and a king <br>
               I've been up and down and over and out <br> 
               And I know one thing <br>
               Each time I find my self flat on my face <br> 
               I pick myself up and get back in the race <br>
               <br>
               That's life (that's life), I tell ya, I can't deny it <br>
               I thought of quitting, baby <br>
               But my heart just ain't gonna buy it <br>
               And if I didn't think it was worth one single try <br>
               I'd jump right on a big bird and then I'd fly <br>
               <br>
               I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate <br>
               A poet, a pawn and a king <br>
               I've been up and down and over and out <br>
               And I know one thing <br>
               Each time I find myself layin' flat on my face <br>
               I just pick myself up and get back in the race <br>
               <br>
               That's life (that's life), that's Life <br>
               And I can't deny it <br>
               Many times I thought of cuttin' out by my heart won't buy it <br>
               But if there's nothing shakin' come this here July <br>
               I'm gonna roll myself up in a big ball and die <br>
               My, my <br>
               <br>                    - Frank Sinatra

           <h4>
               Important things to remember:
           </h4>

           <ul>
           <p>
               There's no one who never failed. Everyone fails. But what the important <br>
               thing is that, you should learn from these failures. And should not be <br>
               afraid of them. Because if you are, then success will not come for you.
           </p>
        </ul>

        <ul>
           <p>
               Don't listen to people who are giving you advice, who are not themselves <br>
               going ahead in life, because many times they cannot see you going ahead, <br>
               and want to see you not successful. But listen to those who are either <br>
               successful or going ahead in their own life because there might be cases <br>
               that they also help you get to the successs.
           </p>
